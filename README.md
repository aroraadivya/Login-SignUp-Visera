 "First, we made quite a few changes, merged pull requests, etc., and now we have finalized the login and signup pages. We will make more changes moving forward."

 
In the sign-up page, new fields have been added, specifically for the user's email and a confirm password option to ensure that users enter their password correctly by typing it twice. On the other hand, in the login page, the email field has been introduced as the primary identifier for users to log in to their accounts. Additionally, the name field has been removed from the login process to streamline it and focus on just the email and password for authentication. This simplifies the user experience by reducing the number of fields required for logging in.
